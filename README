An implementation of the BLAKE SHA-3 candidate hash algorithms in Haskell,
including BLAKE-256, BLAKE-512, BLAKE-224, and BLAKE-384.

The folder `./blakesum` contains source for a `blakesum` library which 
provides the hash functions.

The folder `./blakesum-demo` contains an executable program which demonstrates a use of these.
